# Cartoonization-


A Python program for cartoonizing an image using only Canny Edge Detection. This implementation uses OpenCV's Canny function to detect edges in the input image and create a cartoon-like representation of the image by suppressing non-edge pixels and enhancing the remaining edges. The resulting image is a stylized version of the original that retains the important edges while smoothing out other details. No thresholding techniques are used in this implementation, making it a unique approach to cartoonization.

CONCLUSION: A small test trying to make sketch like border on a png image using python
